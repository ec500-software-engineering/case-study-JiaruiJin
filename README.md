## 1.Technology and Platform used for development
**What coding languages are used?Do you think the same languages would be used if the project was started today?What languages would you use for the project if starting it today?**    
Javascript and React. Yes, because React Native uses real native components and APIs to interact with our code which is written in Javascript and React. So you don't need to be expert in Swift, Kotlin or Java.
**What build system is used? What build tools / environment are needed to build?**  
You will need:  
Node(8.3 or newer)  
the React Native command line interface   
`npm install -g react-native-cli`    
Python2(not support Python3 now)  
JDK (edition 1.8 only) [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)   
Android Studio: While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Android Studio in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for Android.  
**What frameworks / libraries are used in the project?**  
[Libraries](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/Libraries)
## Testing: describe unit/integration/module tests and the test framework
How are they ensuring the testing is meaningful? Do they have code coverage metrics for example?  
What CI platform(s) are they using (e.g. Travis-CI, AppVeyor)?    
What computing platform combinations are tested on their CI? E.g. Windows 10, Cygwin, Linux, Mac, GCC, Clang
## Software architecture in your own words, including:
## Analyze two defects in the project
## Making a demonstration application of the system, your own application showing how the software is used
